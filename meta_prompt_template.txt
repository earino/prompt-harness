## Your Task

Generate a meta-prompt that nonprofit professionals can use with ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI tools. The prompt should:

1. **Define a System Role**: Set the AI's expertise and perspective (e.g., "You are a seasoned nonprofit grant writer with 15 years of experience...")

2. **Use Structured Inputs**: Instead of generic [BRACKETS], define specific variable names that accept structured data:
   - Use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for variables
   - Specify data types and formats
   - Include optional parameters for customization
   - Example: DONOR_FIRST_NAME, DONATION_AMOUNT, ORGANIZATION_MISSION_SUMMARY

3. **Specify Output Requirements**: Be explicit about:
   - Length (word count or approximate)
   - Tone and voice characteristics
   - Structure and formatting
   - Key elements that must be included
   - Quality criteria

4. **Incorporate Domain Best Practices**: Embed sector-specific knowledge:
   - Donor psychology (for fundraising)
   - Brand voice considerations
   - Accessibility and readability
   - Cultural sensitivity
   - Regulatory compliance where relevant

5. **Include Quality Controls**: Build in self-checking mechanisms:
   - Internal validation questions the AI should ask itself
   - Revision triggers
   - Quality thresholds
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

6. **Provide Concrete Guidance**: Give specific direction on:
   - Sentence structure and pacing
   - Emotional resonance techniques
   - Storytelling elements
   - Call-to-action strategies (if appropriate)
   - What to avoid (clichés, empty language, etc.)

7. **Include an Example Invocation**: Show how a user would actually use this prompt with sample data filled in

## Output Format

### **Quality Controls**

After generating the draft:

1. **Self-check:**
   * [Quality question 1]
   * [Quality question 2]
2. If any issues, revise before final output.

### **Best Practices to Incorporate**

[Domain-specific guidance based on research]

---

### **Example Invocation**

```
Generate a [content type] using:
INPUT_VARIABLE_1 = "example"
INPUT_VARIABLE_2 = "example"
[etc.]
```
```

## Important Guidelines

- Write for nonprofit professionals with limited AI experience
- Assume the prompt will be used in ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini
- Incorporate research findings about nonprofit constraints (time, budget, staff capacity)
- Ensure prompts produce usable outputs with minimal editing
- Avoid jargon unless essential to the domain
- Make quality controls actionable and specific
