      "user_context": "Development Directors managing 100-500 donors, need to personalize mid-level acknowledgments but lack time to write from scratch. Mid-level donors ($100-999) are critical for annual fund but often overlooked between major gifts and small donations.",
      "best_practices": "Send within 48 hours, acknowledge upgrade from previous gift if applicable, specific impact metrics for their giving level, personal touch from leadership, no immediate ask, subtle stewardship path indicated.",
      "pain_points": "Too many thank-yous to write individually, struggle to differentiate from small donor letters, want to make mid-level donors feel valued without major gift treatment, need to encourage retention and future upgrades."

      "pain_points": "Unsure how to acknowledge the lapse without making donor feel bad, difficult to re-establish connection after time gap, concerned about seeming desperate or pushy, want to remind of impact without sounding transactional.",
      "best_practices": "Acknowledge the gap warmly, share update on organization progress since last gift, no guilt or pressure, emphasize 'we miss you' not 'we need money', provide specific easy action (not just 'donate again'), keep tone positive and forward-looking, use 'we'd love to see you back' language."

      "best_practices": "Lead with impact statistic or outcome, tell story in first 2 lines (hook for feed), use 3-5 short paragraphs, include call-to-action, tag partners when appropriate, use 3-5 relevant hashtags, professional tone but not corporate, 100-200 words optimal for engagement.",

      "best_practices": "Clear role title, 2-3 sentence overview, specific responsibilities (bulleted), time commitment specified, required vs preferred qualifications separate, impact statement (what volunteers accomplish), welcoming tone, remove barriers to entry, 200-300 words.",
      "pain_points": "Finding volunteers is hard, need to be welcoming but clear about commitment, avoiding scary legal language while covering liability, balancing 'easy to join' with 'serious commitment', competing with for-profit opportunities, limited staff time to onboard."
