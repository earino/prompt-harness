      "best_practices": "Define eligible positions. Core hours vs. flexible hours. Remote/hybrid/in-office options by role. Communication expectations (response times, meetings). Technology requirements and support. Workspace and ergonomics. Performance standards same regardless of location. Trial periods. Review annually. 2-3 pages.",
      "why_it_matters": "Remote work flexibility is now competitive requirement for talent attraction. Clear policies prevent resentment and confusion. Remote options expand geographic talent pool. Flexibility improves work-life balance and retention. Hybrid policies are cost-neutral or reduce office overhead. Policy clarity protects organization and employees."
