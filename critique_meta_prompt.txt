**Weak:** "Write a newsletter for [ORG] about [TOPIC]."
- No length, no structure, no tone, no nonprofit context

**Strong:** "Write a monthly newsletter for [ORGANIZATION NAME] sharing program updates from [MONTH/QUARTER]. The newsletter should: [8-10 specific bullets including length (400-600 words), sections (program highlights with metrics, upcoming events, donor thank-you, call-to-action), tone ([WARM/PROFESSIONAL/INSPIRING]), scannable format with headers, mobile-friendly design considerations]. The newsletter should feel personal and mission-focused, not corporate. Include metrics that show impact without overwhelming readers."
